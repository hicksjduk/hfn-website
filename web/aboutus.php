<h1>About us</h1>
<p>Fairtrade is a simple way in which people in Britain can make a
	difference to the world's poor by the choices they make when shopping.
	We are a network of local groups whose aim is to promote Fairtrade in
	Hampshire.
<p>
	We were formed at a meeting in Eastleigh in September 2010, and agreed
	<a href="page.php?id=constitution">our constitution</a> at a subsequent
	meeting in November. Our inaugural Annual General Meeting and gathering was held in
	Winchester in May 2011, and we have since held gatherings in Basingstoke (2012),
	Havant (2013 and 2017), Andover (2014) and Eastleigh (2015).
<p>
	We are a member of the <a href="http://www.hampshirechamber.co.uk">Hampshire
		Chamber of Commerce</a>.
